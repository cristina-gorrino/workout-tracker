## Description

![MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

This application allows the user to track their workouts, and easily add multiple exercises to a workout on a given day. The user can create a new workout, and add one or more exercises, including details like weight, reps, duration, and if it's a cardio exercise it includes distance. The user can also see a stats page that graphs key data from the last 7 workouts.
